## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I learned how to use flexbox more accurately, and how it works at time of designing something. Also, i learned that (or that's what i think) i don't need to forcedly put a text into a <p> tag to arrange into a css design. Also, this teached me how to work more efficantly with the properties and tools instead of just typing things randomly waiting to get it more ordered acording to the sample image.


### Continued development

i'm very noob at it, but i want to keep improving my css and my frontend development skills. I want to know more deeply how flexbox works, and how can i make better designs cleverly.
